Program to fit correlation functions at different temperatures.

Before commiting any changes, please run,
```bash
make 
```
it will set up a git hook that forces the commits to pass some 
tests defined in the folder `tests`.


## To dos

- [x] -> Calculate the correlation function central value and
  bootstrap.
- [x] -> Implemented most of the correlation function basics.
- [x] -> Implemented IO modules.
- [x] -> Implemented fitting procedure using Nelder-Mead algorithm
- [ ] -> Build main program to fit at different temperatures.
- [ ] -> Build a MPI application.
